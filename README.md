# Advice Generator App

 This a React project that uses Next.js and Tailwind CSS to create a simple web app that displays random advice from an API. The app has a minimalist design and a dice button that allows the user to get new advice.

## Installation

To run the project locally, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Navigate to the project folder and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the app.

## Usage

The app shows a random piece of advice on the main screen, along with its ID number. You can click on the dice button to get a new piece of advice. The app uses the [Advice Slip JSON API](^1^) to fetch the data.

## Credits

This project was inspired by the [Random Advice Generator](^3^) challenge from [Frontend Mentor](^4^).
